### Machine Learning
- Underdeveloped country clustering using K Means: K-Means Clustering method is used to cluster which underdeveloped countries are the most urgent to be helped by NGO. This project include Exploratory analysis (EDA), Outlier treatment, dan 3D data visualization.
- Public sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes: Gaussian Naive Bayes method is used to classify DKI Jakarta residents sentiment analysis of Indonesia capital city transfer to Penajam Paser Utara, East Kalimantan. The analysis result answered 2 questions, (1) Are they agree with the captial city transfer? and (2) What is the reason behind their agreement/disagreement? This project include (legal) Webscraping using twitter API, Text preprocessing, Text analysis, and Topic analysis with Hyperparameter tuning.

### Data Analysis
- IMBD Movie dataset: Import dataset from IMDB Movies database using SQL query requested using Python and then do analysis, such as directors with the most movies, highest earning movie directors, most profitable movies, and visualizing the movie budgets distribution of particular year.
